/*

Callback and Callback Hell in JavaScript
1. What is a Callback?

ðŸ‘‰ A callback is simply a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed later.

âœ… Interview one-liner:
"A callback is a function passed to another function to be executed after a task is completed, often used in asynchronous operations like reading files, making API requests, or timers."

Example
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
  callback();
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Sameer", sayBye);
// Output:
// Hello, Sameer
// Goodbye!


ðŸ‘‰ Here sayBye is the callback, executed after greeting.

2. Callback in Asynchronous Operations
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Task done after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);


âœ… The anonymous function is a callback executed later by the event loop.

3. What is Callback Hell?

ðŸ‘‰ Callback Hell happens when callbacks are nested inside other callbacks, leading to deeply indented, unreadable, and hard-to-maintain code.

Example (classic "pyramid of doom"):
getUser(1, function(user) {
  getPosts(user.id, function(posts) {
    getComments(posts[0].id, function(comments) {
      getLikes(comments[0].id, function(likes) {
        console.log("Likes:", likes);
      });
    });
  });
});


ðŸ˜µ Looks messy, hard to debug, and difficult to handle errors.

4. Problems with Callback Hell

Readability: Code becomes deeply nested (pyramid structure).

Maintainability: Hard to add/modify logic.

Error Handling: Must check errors at each level.

Scalability: Not suitable for complex async workflows.

5. How Callback Hell is Solved?

ðŸ‘‰ Callback hell is avoided using Promises and async/await.

Using Promises
getUser(1)
  .then(user => getPosts(user.id))
  .then(posts => getComments(posts[0].id))
  .then(comments => getLikes(comments[0].id))
  .then(likes => console.log("Likes:", likes))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

Using Async/Await
async function showLikes() {
  try {
    const user = await getUser(1);
    const posts = await getPosts(user.id);
    const comments = await getComments(posts[0].id);
    const likes = await getLikes(comments[0].id);
    console.log("Likes:", likes);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}


âœ… Much cleaner and synchronous-looking.

6. Follow-up Interview Questions

Q1: What is the main drawback of callbacks?
ðŸ‘‰ Callback hell, poor error handling, inversion of control (caller depends too much on callee).

Q2: Difference between synchronous and asynchronous callbacks?
ðŸ‘‰ Sync callbacks run immediately (like in Array.map()), async callbacks run later (like setTimeout, API calls).

Q3: How did Promises improve over callbacks?
ðŸ‘‰ Flat structure, better error handling with .catch, chaining, and integration with async/await.

Q4: Can callbacks still be useful today?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes â€” in event listeners, forEach/map methods, or when you want lightweight async without Promises.

âœ… Interview-ready summary:
"A callback is a function passed into another function to be executed later. But when multiple async operations are nested, it leads to callback hell â€” code that is hard to read and maintain. This is why Promises and async/await were introduced, providing cleaner chaining and error handling."
