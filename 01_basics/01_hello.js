console.log("hello world!"); // hello world program

// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, not a statically typed one. 
// This means that:

// Type checks are performed at runtime,

// not during compilation. You do not explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you define it in JavaScript. The interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned to it, and this type can change during the program's execution.
// Flexibility in variable types:

// A single variable can hold values of different types throughout the program's execution. For example, a variable initially holding a number can later be assigned a string.
